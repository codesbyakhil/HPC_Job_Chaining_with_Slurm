# HPC_Job_Chaining_with_Slurm
A lightweight Slurm job-chaining setup for HPC clusters that automates sequential simulation runs. Submit multiple jobs at once with automatic `afterok` dependencies, ensuring each run starts only after the previous one succeeds—saving time, effort, and allocation credits.
